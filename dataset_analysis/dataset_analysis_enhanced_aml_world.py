"""
Network density is a measure of how many connections (edges)
 exist in a network compared to the maximum possible number of connections. It provides an indication of how well connected the network is.
  A higher density means that the network is more tightly connected, while a lower density suggests a sparse or fragmented network.

Degree distribution is a fundamental characteristic of a network that describes the frequency 
with which nodes in the network have a given degree (number of connections). In other words, it shows how many
 nodes are connected to a certain number of other nodes. This distribution provides insights into the overall structure of the network,
  such as whether most nodes have a similar degree (indicative of a uniform network) or if there are a few highly connected nodes (hubs) 
  alongside many sparsely connected nodes (indicative of a scale-free network). Degree distribution is often visualized as a histogram or a plot, 
  showing the degrees on the x-axis and their frequencies or normalized percentages on the y-axis. This analysis is 
critical in fields like social networks, biological systems, and financial networks, as it helps identify patterns such as hubs,
 robustness, and potential vulnerabilities.
